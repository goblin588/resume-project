    <p>
        Penultimate year student pursuing a double degree in Physics and Software Engineering. I have some experience in Physics research through lab internships and CAPSTONE work, 
        with a keen interest in Quantum mechanics. I am passionate about exploring the intersection of Software Engineering and Physics. Particularly algorithm design and software
         development. I have experience coding mostly in C# and Python however have also worked with languages like java, html, css, javascript and many others to varying degrees 
         and am always looking to add more to my skillset.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a solid foundation in Physics and a growing skill set in Software Engineering, I am actively seeking opportunities to bridge these disciplines and find a career that combines my 
        interests. I am open to exciting opportunities where I can leverage my interdisciplinary background and contribute to meaningful projects.
    </p>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Griffith University Centre for Quantum Dynamics</h3>
    <h5>Jan 23 - Present</h5>
    <p>
        Participated in a seven-week experimental research internship at the Quantum Optics Lab. The role involved hands-on experience 
        in lab optics and the application of machine learning to optimize 'beam walking' coupling.
    </p>
    <p>
        Had some lab experience building a 'beam walking' coupling setup and manually coupling with single mode fibres then over 
        the course of the 7 weeks. developed an algorithm using Gaussian estimation methods to predict and iteratively enhance the 
        alignment of 4 axial parameters (two Zaber TMM-2 motor-mounted mirrors) based off the output measured with a power meter in 
        order to effectively determine the most optimal mirror positions for alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project was coded in Python, though Git and GitHub were also used for version control systems in VSCode, enabling regular 
        progress tracking and software accessibility for other researchers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The outcome of this internship was a working model which could successfully optimise the set up though there was more work 
        to be completed in cleaning up the code, making it more readable and turning it into a library as well as work to improve 
        efficiency of optimisation and including some methods for displaying the data aquired during runs for analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        I really enjoyed this experience and significantly developed my skills in programming, and problem-solving amongst having the 
        chance to talk to many of the amazing researchers in CQD.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was invited to continue working on the project which i started summer 2023. The project was about development of an algorithm 
        to optimize laser to single mode fiber coupling. This extension of the project would see the algorithm expanded from 2 to 4 axial
        dimensions, and wrapping the scripting up and migrating onto GitHub with other features so that the program can be installed and
         used by researchers in the lab.
    </p>
    <p>
        The github repositiory i used for this project is available <a href="https://github.com/goblin588/auto-mirror-align">here</a> with a README doc that explains the project in further detail.
    </p>
    <h3>QUT Quantum Cognition</h3>
    <h5>Starting August 23</h5>
    <p>
        Was provided with a scholarship to begin a project with QUTs Quantum Congnition Researchers. This project is a mix of the 
        mathematics behind quantum mechanics
        with applied principles of psychology and cognitive studies as well as an IT and data analytics aspect in modelling as the group 
        is technically under QUTs school of Information Technology.
    </p>
    <h3>Undergraduate Physics CAPSTONE project</h3>
    <h5>July 22 - Nov 22</h5>
    <p>
        CAPSTONE Research Project in Biophysics. Involved working closely with PhD Students / Post-docs in imaging Collagen samples with
         Second Harmonic Generation and Piezo Force Microscopy for the purpose of investigating their piezoelectric qualities. The project 
         served as a good introduction to lab work as well as the two aforementioned measurement processes. A report and presentation were 
         created to finalize the results found and discuss their meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
        The article which i wrote for this project is available in pdf form <a href="./assets/PDF/Probing of Collagen Piezoelectricity and Imaging Techniques.pdf">here</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Software Engineering Honours Project</h3>
    <h5>Feb 24- Nov 24</h5>
    <p>
        Project which i will undertake next year for my honours in software engineering.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Undergraduate Degree - Bachelors of Physics and Software Engineering</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Studying a double degree of Engineering and Science at QUT. I major in Physics and Software
    Engineering. This has given me skills in many fields including mathematics and computer literacy. It
    has also introduced me to the different theoretical fields of which I have taken a special interest. I
    have achieved a GPA of 5.3 across my 4 years at university and particularly enjoyed units including
    electromagnetic, quantum, and thermodynamic theory.
    </p>
    <p>
    In my degree, I have completed several experimental physics units including setting up and calibrating
    apparatus, measuring and recording experimental data, and detailing results in reports. I have also
    used software to refine, analyze and model data in MatLab, RStudio, SciDavis, Excel and Python. In my
    engineering degree, I have designed and constructed projects including a brushed DC engine, a cloud
    connected raspberry pi-based motion detecting camera, a haptic feedback glove designed to replace a
    white cane for visually impaired people, and more.
